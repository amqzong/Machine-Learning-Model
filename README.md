#MasterLord: This script is the master code. It makes use of "parfor," a parallel computing tool on Matlab, in order to run 1000 iterations of the machine learning model by calling upon the script "MasterCost" in each iteration. In each iteration, 70% of the images were randomly selected as the training set, while the remaining 30% of the images were used as the test set to evaluate the parameters determined from running the algorithms on the training set. For each image, the probability scores from all the iterations were averaged for the final probability of melanoma for each image. The final probabilities were then compared with the standard histopathologic diagnoses for the 112 images. This comparison was used to plot a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The optimal threshold for classifying melanoma was determined by choosing the highest specificity at 98% sensitivity.

#MasterCost: This script contains the code for the 5 machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forest (Figure 3). Logistic regression and neural networks were manually coded for.
